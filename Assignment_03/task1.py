# # Problem 01
# #
# # The purpose of this problem is to assess how various ways of processing lists compare in terms
# # of efficiency.
# # (a) Generate a list A of random floats, between -1.0 and 1.0. It should have 1,000,000 entries.
# # See here on how to generate random numbers in python.
# # (b) Use list comprehensions to generate another list that takes every other entry in A, from
# # end to beginning, and squares it. This would be list B (half the length of A).
# # (c) Just bullet (1b) above, but instead use now a for-loop for the same list A to get list C
# # (should be identical to B).
# # (d) Just bullet (1b) above, but instead use now a while-loop to get list D.
# # (e) Using process time, assess how much time in seconds it takes to get B,C, and D.
# # (f) Print the time taken to generate B, the first element of B and the last element of B. Do the
# # same for the for-loop and while-loop (see sample output below).
